# Jose's Resumé

## Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This project is part of my journey as a Software Developer in Code Institute. Here, you will find
a clear and organized resumé of myself. I have included my work and education history, including
my academic track record as a researcher in physics as well as my tech training in areas of data science 
and software development. You will also find link to public social networks profiles such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate and LinkedIn,
and my development projects available on GitHub. You will be able to download two different versions of my Resumé:
a full academic curriculum and a summarised one highlighting my background, experience and skills.

## Demo

### Strategy:

The goal of this project is to get noticed among potential recruiters and scientific collaborators. 
In the design of this project, my main goal was to make it attractive by highlighting main aspects
in the different sections and adding link to external sources. 


### Scope:

## Stage 1 (current release)

As the initial stage of this project:

- I wanted to include the most important pieces of my resumé:
About Me, Education Background, Work Experience, Portfolio (including different pilars of my professional profile,
 i.e. data analytics, software development and scientific research), Summary of my Tech Skills.

- I also wanted to have a responsive design including mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

- I wanted to include just a bit of animation by using JavaScript capabilities provided by Bootstrap, in particular
for the field validation in the contact form.

- I wanted to include a scroll animation by using **ScrollReveal** library.

- I wanted to improve the user experience by adding a link to another page (with a short message) when clicking "Send Message" button.

## Stage 2 (Future release)

As future capabilities:

- I would like to include more interactive features to the website by using JavaScript.
In particular, it will have and interactive showcase of my projects in the Portfolio Section, Send messages fully operational
and live chat option.

- Update projects.


### Structure:

As it can be noticed in the initial wireframes, I was initially considering to organise my website in different pages. However, 
in order to make the user experience more comfortable I decided to organise my website in a single page with different separated 
sections.

- Home Section: I have included a horizontal navegation bar fixed to the top (for desktop screen size), which collapses to
  one icon for mobile screen size. I have included my own background picture (taken in Bariloche - Patagonia, Argentina in 2014)
  providing a beautiful eye-catching initial impression of the website. I present myself, with call outs buttons for downloading CV and
  contacting me. Social media links are also included.

- The following sections are organized in a logical way as typical resumes are presented.

- About Me Section: Including personal picture, with personal details and a summary of background and main interests.

- My Tech Skills Section: Including a progress bar of my main Tech Skills (the percentages included are quite representative
  of my experience).

- My Resumé Section: Including a descending chronological showcase of my university degrees and professional experience.  

- My Portfolio Section: Divided in three main subsections, i.e. Data Science, Software Development and Research, with link to external
  websites.

- Contact Me Section: Including contact information and a contact form.  

- Footer: Divided in three columns, i.e. brief summary of my profile, social links and download CV options. 


### Skeleton:

I used Balsamiq to create my initial wireframes, starting with the Desktop design as an overall idea and helping me to make the design responsive afterwards.

### Surface:

- The CSS Family Blue Color Scheme was chosen for backgrounds, in order to make compatible with color in Home page background
picture.

- The CSS Family Orange Color Scheme was chosen for progress bars, social links and hoover effects on the desktop navegation bar.

- The CSS Family White Color Scheme was chosen for text on Home and Footer pages.

- The CSS Family Gray Color Scheme was chosen for text on other body sections.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
