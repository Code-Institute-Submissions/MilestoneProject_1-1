# Jose's Resumé

## Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This project is part of my journey as a Software Developer in Code Institute. Here, you will find
a clear and organized resumé of myself. I have included my work and education history, including
my academic track record as a researcher in physics as well as my tech training in areas of data science 
and software development. You will also find link to public social networks profiles such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate and LinkedIn,
and my development projects available on GitHub. You will be able to download two different versions of my Resumé:
a full academic curriculum and a summarised one highlighting my background, experience and skills.

### Strategy:

The goal of this project is to get noticed among potential recruiters and scientific collaborators. 
In the design of this project, my main goal was to make it attractive by highlighting main aspects
in the different sections and adding link to external sources. 


### Scope:

## Stage 1 (current release)

As the initial stage of this project:

- I wanted to include the most important pieces of my resumé:
About Me, Education Background, Work Experience, Portfolio (including different pilars of my professional profile,
 i.e. data analytics, software development and scientific research), Summary of my Tech Skills.

- I also wanted to have a responsive design including mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

- I wanted to include just a bit of animation by using JavaScript capabilities provided by Bootstrap, in particular
for the field validation in the contact form.

- I wanted to include a scroll animation by using **ScrollReveal** library.

- I wanted to improve the user experience by adding a link to another page (with a short message) when clicking "Send Message" button.

## Stage 2 (Future release)

As future capabilities:

- I would like to include more interactive features to the website by using JavaScript.
In particular, it will have and interactive showcase of my projects in the Portfolio Section, Send messages fully operational
and live chat option.

- Update projects.


### Structure:

As it can be noticed in the initial wireframes, I was initially considering to organise my website in different pages. However, 
in order to make the user experience more comfortable I decided to organise my website in a single page with different separated 
sections.

- Home Section: I have included a horizontal navegation bar fixed to the top (for desktop screen size), which collapses to
  one icon for mobile screen size. I have included my own background picture (taken in Bariloche - Patagonia, Argentina in 2014)
  providing a beautiful eye-catching initial impression of the website. I present myself, with call outs buttons for downloading CV and
  contacting me. Social media links are also included.

- The following sections are organized in a logical way as typical resumes are presented.

- About Me Section: Including personal picture, with personal details and a summary of background and main interests.

- My Tech Skills Section: Including a progress bar of my main Tech Skills (the percentages included are quite representative
  of my experience).

- My Resumé Section: Including a descending chronological showcase of my university degrees and professional experience.  

- My Portfolio Section: Divided in three main subsections, i.e. Data Science, Software Development and Research, with link to external
  websites.

- Contact Me Section: Including contact information and a contact form.  

- Footer: Divided in three columns, i.e. brief summary of my profile, social links and download CV options. 


### Skeleton:

I used Balsamiq to create my initial wireframes, starting with the Desktop design as an overall idea and helping me to make the design responsive afterwards.

picture.

- The CSS Family White Color Scheme was chosen for text on Home and Footer pages.

- The CSS Family Gray Color Scheme was chosen for text on other body sections.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
I first created a new repository on my GitHub account, and then I linked my repository the my GitPod 
environment, where I edited all files before every commit.

I used the GitPod terminal in order to add files, commit and push using Git version control.

The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting
`git clone https://github.com/jdquerales/MilestoneProject_1.git` into your terminal
into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
