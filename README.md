# Jose's Resumé

## Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This project is part of my journey as a Software Developer in Code Institute. Here, you will find
a clear and organized resumé of myself. I have included my work and education history, including
my academic track record as a researcher in physics as well as my tech training in areas of data science 
and software development. You will also find link to public social networks profiles such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate and LinkedIn,
and my development projects available on GitHub. You will be able to download two different versions of my Resumé:
a full academic curriculum and a summarised one highlighting my background, experience and skills.

## Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://jdquerales.github.io/MilestoneProject_1/).

## UX
 
### User stories:


#### As a recruiter:


-  I want to view the developer’s educational background, so that I can determine 
   the suitability of the candidate for the position.

-  I want to be able to learn about the developer technical skills, so that I can assess whether they can fit 
   within the position requirements.

#### As a potential collaborator:

-  I want to view the developer’s educational background, so that I can assess his field of expertise and education level.

-  I want to have access to the researcher’s full list of publications, so that I can assess his track record and leadership in the his field of research. 

-  I want to learn about the researcher’s scientific interest and current field of research, so that I can consider him as a potential collaborations in areas of common interest.

-  I want to learn about the researcher’s computational skills, so that I can assure the feasibility of the methods to be employed in our research.


#### As a recruiter or potential collaborator, I want to be able to download a full curriculum vitae of the developer/researcher, so that I can see more details on his achievements and career progression.

### Skeleton:

I used Balsamiq to create my initial wireframes, starting with the Desktop design as an overall idea and helping me to make the design responsive afterwards.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
    - The project uses **HTML** as building block.
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
    - The project uses **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** for adding style to the website.

    - The project uses **Balsamiq** as wireframing tool.
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
    - I use **Chrome DevTools** to inspect and test styling and responsive desing during my development process.
- [W3C](https://validator.w3.org)
    - I use **W3C** to check the HTML and CSS files.
- [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is)
    - I use **Am I Responsive?** to check my responsive design and take screenshots of the deployed website.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    - This project uses **FontAwesome** for including vector icons and social logos.
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com)
    - This project uses **GoogleFonts** to import the font styles.
- [GitHub](https://github.com)

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
    - I used **GitHub Pages** to deploy my project.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io)
    - I used **GitPod** as the cloud-based development environment to write my code.
 
## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
